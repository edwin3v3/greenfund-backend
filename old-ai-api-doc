# ðŸŒ¾ GreenFund AI API Documentation

---

[cite_start]**Project Name:** GreenFund: AI-Driven Climate-Smart Farming [cite: 2]

**Purpose:** This document details the implementation, data flow, and underlying prompt strategies for the Artificial Intelligence services integrated into the GreenFund platform. [cite_start]The AI layer is designed to transform raw data (weather, soil, activity) into actionable, farm-specific advice aligned with climate action and sustainability goals. [cite: 3, 4]

**Architecture:** All AI functions are managed by the **FastAPI Backend**. [cite_start]The frontend application consumes these services via standard REST endpoints. [cite: 5]

[cite_start]**Logic & Prompt Strategy:** [cite: 13]

1.  [cite_start]**Data Ingestion:** Backend fetches the farm's current crop type and the 7-day local weather forecast (temperature, humidity, precipitation). [cite: 14]
2.  [cite_start]**Risk Assessment (Python Logic):** Simple Python logic performs initial anomaly detection (e.g., identifying three consecutive days of high humidity or sudden temperature drops). [cite: 15]
3.  [cite_start]**LLM Call:** The summarized risk factors are injected into the following System Prompt: [cite: 16]
    - [cite_start]**SYSTEM INSTRUCTION:** "You are 'GreenFund Predict', a pre-emptive agricultural risk advisor. Based on the data provided, identify the most likely pest or disease risk for the specified crop in the next 7 days. Your output must be in a highly structured JSON format." [cite: 16]
    - [cite_start]**USER QUERY:** "The farm has [Crop Name]. Recent analysis shows: [List of Risk Factors, e.g., '3 days of >85% humidity']. What is the top risk, its severity (Low/Medium/High), and the specific pre-emptive advice for the farmer?" [cite: 17]

| :-------- | :------ | :----------------------------------------- |
| `farm_id` | Integer | [cite_start]The target farm ID. [cite: 20] |

[cite_start]**Logic & Prompt Strategy:** [cite: 21]

1.  [cite_start]**Data Ingestion:** Backend gathers farm details (size, crop) and the historical log of Farm Activity (e.g., recent tilling, fertilizer use). [cite: 22]
2.  [cite_start]**LLM Call:** The AI is tasked with suggesting concrete behavioral changes to meet climate goals. [cite: 23]
    - [cite_start]**SYSTEM INSTRUCTION:** "You are 'GreenFund Carbon Analyst'. Your goal is to suggest sustainable farming practices common in **East Africa** that actively increase soil carbon sequestration and reduce overall emissions. Provide three distinct, immediate actions." [cite: 24]
    - [cite_start]**USER QUERY:** "Given the farm is [Size] acres, currently growing [Crop], and the last activity was [Activity Type], provide 3 high-impact, actionable steps to increase carbon sequestration. For each action, estimate the relative effort and potential CO2e benefit." [cite: 25]
