## ü§ñ AI & ML Features

This project integrates AI to provide agronomic assistance and enrich soil/farm insights. The AI components combine simple rule-based logic (in `app/climate_rules.py`) with OpenAI-powered prompts (via `app/soil_model.py` and `app/recommendations.py`) to produce actionable guidance.

Key AI-powered capabilities:

- Chatbot: a farmer-facing assistant available at POST `/api/chatbot/ask` (router prefix `/chatbot`). The chatbot uses a system prompt tuned for Kenyan smallholder farmers and returns a short reply.
- Soil analysis (text): POST `/api/soil/manual` ‚Äî submit soil measurements and the system will call the AI to return `ai_analysis_text` and `suggested_crops` which are stored with the `SoilReport`.
- Soil analysis (image): POST `/api/soil/upload_soil_image/{farm_id}` ‚Äî upload a soil image; the backend sends the image to the AI multi-modal endpoint and stores the parsed analysis as a `SoilReport`.
- Crop suggestions summary: GET `/api/soil/suggestions/summary` ‚Äî aggregates the latest AI suggestions across the user's farms.
- Climate actions: endpoints under `/api/climate-actions` use both rule-based assessments and AI refinement to provide:
  - Pest/disease alerts: GET `/api/climate-actions/alerts/{farm_id}`
  - Carbon guidance: GET `/api/climate-actions/carbon-guidance/{farm_id}`
  - Water management advice: GET `/api/climate-actions/water-management/{farm_id}`

Configuration & environment variables:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` ‚Äî required to use OpenAI services. Add it to your `.env` when running with real AI calls.

Example `.env` snippet:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxx-your-key-xxxx
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@db:5432/app_db
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
```

Cost, latency and safety notes:

- AI calls incur costs and add latency to endpoints ‚Äî consider async patterns, caching, or background tasks for heavier jobs (e.g., large image analysis).
- Limit model usage and add rate-limiting / quotas to protect against abuse and runaway costs (not implemented by default).
- Ensure user consent for sending images/data to third-party AI services and consider redacting sensitive information.

Testing & local development (mocking AI):

- For tests, avoid calling the real OpenAI API. Mock `app.soil_model.get_openai_client` or patch the OpenAI client methods to return canned responses. Example strategies:
  - Use pytest monkeypatch to replace `get_openai_client` with a fake client that implements `.chat.completions.create`.
  - Use VCR-like fixtures to replay recorded responses if you have stable outputs.

Security and data retention:

- Store only the AI outputs that are necessary (the app stores `ai_analysis_text` and `suggested_crops`). Log minimal information about API responses.
- Rotate `OPENAI_API_KEY` regularly and do not commit it to source control. Use environment-backed secrets (Docker secrets, vault, etc.) in production.
